# Arch Rice

ArchRice is deprecated now. See [rdconfig](https://github.com/RishabhRD/rdconfig)
for my dots.

## Why?

- Because I started to maintain it in my first year of undergrad. It has so much
mess in git history. Now I am stopping to maintain it in my final year of
undergrad.

- I don't want to download 21 MB archrice just to maintain simple files.
